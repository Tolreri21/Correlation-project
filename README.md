# Film Dataset Correlation Analysis

## Overview  
This project explores correlations within a film dataset to uncover relationships between various features such as budget, revenue, and votes.

## Hypothesis  
The initial hypothesis was that **budget** and **revenue** are positively correlated.

## Tools Used  
- **pandas** for data manipulation  
- **NumPy** for numerical operations  
- **matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization

## Methodology  
1. Downloaded and loaded the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.  
2. Performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to handle missing values and understand the data structure.  
3. Created correlation matrices and plots to investigate relationships between variables.  
4. Visualized correlations using matplotlib and Seaborn for clearer insights.

## Findings  
- Confirmed the hypothesis: **budget** and **revenue** are strongly correlated.  
- Discovered an additional correlation between **votes** and **revenue**.
